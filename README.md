# :crystal_ball: first-site-upgrade

## :flying_saucer: ... and with this website project i learn and challenge myself on my journey as a web developer

### :seedling: also this should be an *inspiration* and *resource* for anyone looking to get into or is just getting started with web development

- #### visit the [first site upgrade website](https://glmvc.github.io/first-site-upgrade/) and see for yourself :eyes:
- #### check the [changelog on github](changelog.md) or on the [changelog page on the website](https://glmvc.github.io/first-site-upgrade/) to see what has changed / been improved compared to the [first-site](https://github.com/glmvc/first-site) :clipboard:
- #### do you notice anything that's wrong, not ideal or doesn't follow good practice? :face_with_spiral_eyes:
  - let me know in a message or create an issue
  - or fix it yourself and create a pull request afterwards
  - i try very hard to implement everything with perfection, but as we all know 4 eyes see more than 2 and one cannot know everything
  - for further suggestions / ideas i'm always open

#### :toolbox: used tools, libraries and inspiration for the project

:ferris_wheel: you don't need to go and reinvent the wheel

:joystick: this is meant to be a **motivation** that you can and even should use other resources as well, since it's very hard to do everything yourself these days in this *fast-paced industry*
